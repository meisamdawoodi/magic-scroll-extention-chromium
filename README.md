If you don't have a middle mouse click or find it difficult to scroll through web pages using the middle click, the Magic Scroll Extension is a perfect solution for you. With our innovative drag-to-scroll feature and minimap scrollbar, you can easily navigate long pages without the need for a middle click. Enjoy a seamless browsing experience and take full advantage of the web's content!
Smart scrolling and minimap for improved web navigation.

## Features

Magic Scroll Extension enhances your browsing experience with two main features:

*   **Drag-to-Scroll (Hand Tool):** Click and hold your left mouse button anywhere on a webpage to drag and scroll. This provides a smooth, intuitive way to navigate long pages, similar to using a hand tool in document viewers. A subtle visual effect indicates when the feature is active.
*   **Minimap Scrollbar:** A highly configurable minimap appears on the side of your screen, giving you a bird's-eye view of the entire page. You can quickly see your current position and click or drag on the minimap's thumb to jump to any part of the page.

## How to Use

*   **Drag-to-Scroll:**
    *   Press and hold the left mouse button on any part of the page (except on links or selectable text areas if you want to interact with them normally).
    *   After a short, configurable delay, the drag-to-scroll mode will activate.
    *   Move your mouse to scroll the page.
    *   Release the mouse button to deactivate.

*   **Minimap Scrollbar:**
    *   The minimap will appear on the side of the page (configurable to be on the right or left).
    *   Click anywhere on the minimap track to jump to that relative position on the page.
    *   Click and drag the minimap's thumb to scroll the page.
